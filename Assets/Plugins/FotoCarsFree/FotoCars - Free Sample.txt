FotoCars - Free Sample

low poly photorealistic cars to populate parking lots, streets and highways with.

Main features
- Two LODs. Full model with separate wheels (500 – 600 triangles) and “Box” model with just 60 – 100 triangles. Premade prefabs with LOD groups setup.
- Single mesh variant of full model to make static cars even less resource demanding.
- An optional simple 2 triangle mesh shadow bellow the car. The ultimate low resource shadow solution.
- One texture/material per model.
- Two texture variants. The first is of a static car. The second one has the wheel “Smudged” by rotation. You can tell the smudged variant by a capital S at the end of its name.
- Five different premade prefabs differing mainly in shadow solution. Unity, projected, simple mesh, single mesh and box.
- Meshes in FBX format in Box, Full separate (W) and Full single mesh (1m) variants.
- Textures are 1024x1024. Two per color, static and smudged (S) variants. Bumped and Metallic textures included.
- Materials subfolder with many variants for different shaders.
- Prefabs subfolder with many prefabs for colors, shaders and shadow types.

I hope you find the FotoCars useful. Enjoy.
